# Summary
This repository is a Scrabble clone for Android and iOS made with Compose Multiplatform. This project serves two primary purposes:
1. To act as a learning tool for me to learn about Compose Multiplatform development
2. To demonstrate the kinds of cross-platform UIs that can be built using Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform

# Scope
For the time being, the scope of this project is to support offline play between two players. In the future, single-player mode against an AI and/or online play against another player may be added.

Note: It is specifically not a goal to publish this app for obvious copyright reasons. This repository exists purely for learning and demonstration purposes.
